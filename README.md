# Lightweight-QA-Bot 🤖

A snappy, CPU-friendly chatbot that learns from your Q&A and responds in real-time! Built with Python, MiniBot uses Sentence Transformers for embeddings and cosine similarity to find the best match.

## 🌟 Features

- **🧠 Self-learning:** Learns new Q&A on the fly and stores them in `qa.csv`.
- **🗣️ Text-to-Speech:** Speaks answers using pyttsx3.
- **💾 Cached model:** Downloads once from Hugging Face, loads instantly after.
- **🧩 Expandable:** Add more Q&A to boost its brainpower.
- **🧘 CPU-friendly:** Runs smoothly on laptops—no GPU needed!

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goldstac/Lightweight-QA-Bot.git
cd Lightweight-QA-Bot
```

Install required Python modules:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn pyttsx3 sentence-transformers numpy
```

> 💡 **Note:** CPU-friendly version. No TensorFlow or GPU required.

## 💬 Usage

- Make sure `qa.csv` exists (MiniBot will create it if missing).
- Run the chatbot:

  ```bash
  python index.py
  ```

- Chat with MiniBot!

  - Type a question and wait for a response.
  - If MiniBot doesn’t know the answer, it will ask you to teach it:
    - **MiniBot:** I don't know, can you teach me?
    - **You (teach MiniBot):** [Type your answer here]
    - MiniBot will remember it for next time.

- Type `.exit` or `.quit` to close the chatbot.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Loads all Q&A pairs from `qa.csv`.
2. Converts questions into embedding vectors.
3. Finds the closest match using cosine similarity.
4. If similarity < 0.4, it asks you to teach it.
5. Saves new Q&A and updates embeddings dynamically.

## 🧾 Example

```
You » Hello

MiniBot » Hi there!

You » Who is Trump?

MiniBot » I don't know, can you teach me?

You (teach MiniBot)
∘ Donald Trump is the 47th president of the USA

MiniBot » Got it! I'll remember that.

You » Who is Trump?

MiniBot » Donald Trump is the 47th president of the USA
```
